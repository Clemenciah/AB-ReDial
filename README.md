## Dataset Description

This data consist of annotations at the turn and dialogue level.

### Turn-level Annotation

At the turn level we annotate each turn with two dialogue aspects: *relevance* and *interestingness* and turn-level satisfaction. This data is in the file *annotated_turns.csv*.

Each turn consist of four utterances: two previous utterances as context, current utterance(system utterance) and the next user utterance. 

The labels are relevanceK, interestingessK and overallK, where K is the turn number.

Each turn was annotated with atleast three annotators.
