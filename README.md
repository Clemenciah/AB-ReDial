## Dataset Description

### Turn-level Annotation

At the turn level we annotate each turn with two dialogue aspects: * relevance * and *interestingness* and turn-level satisfaction. This data is in the file _annotated_turns.csv_.

Each turn consist of four utterances: two previous utterances as context, current utterance and the next user utterance. 

The labels are relevanceK, interestingessK and overallK, where K is the turn number.
