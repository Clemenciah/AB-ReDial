Q0,SYSTEM	Hi! What type of movies do you prefer?,"USER	I'm looking for something scary. Blood and gore is okay, but I'd rather have a good story than a good slasher film.","SYSTEM	Ok. Hmm.

I'm watching ""The Purge: Anarchy (2014)"" right now and it's horrible.",3,3,5.0,"SYSTEM	A bad movie can be fun.

Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films.","USER	Ehh....I lived in a small town when ""The Blair Witch Project (1999)"" came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it. And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out. I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it. LOL",1,3,2
